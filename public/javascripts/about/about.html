			Volume IV is a recording studio, rehearsal space, and DIY space
			located in the industrial sector of beautiful New Brunswick, NJ.
		</p>  
		<p class="content-text">	
			Our recording facility represents the joining of forces of longtime 
			friends/recording enthusiasts/gear nerds Chris Pierce (Technical Ecstacy) 
			and Brian Buccellato (Chumbuckets) who have both been heavily involved in 
			serving the local scene since the late 1990's.  The goal of Volume IV is 
			simple: Provide excellent and affordable music production services
			while building a space that fosters a sense of community within the local 
			scene.  We love all things analog and strive for that element of realism
			that can sometimes be lacking in many other modern production houses.  With
			nearly 45 years of experience between Chris and Brian and hundreds of sessions
			spanning just about every genre booked, Volume IV can help you make the record 
			you have always wanted!        
		</p>
		<p class="content-text">
			Whether you are interested in laying down some tracks, looking for a mix house,
			a freelancer looking for a vibey space to work, or just want to rehearse for a 
			few hours, give us a shout.  We love making new friends!
